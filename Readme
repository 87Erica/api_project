Save as you go.

Run the Server:
Run the Flask server by executing the script:
python3 api.py

Access the API:
I opened my browser to access the API at (i.e. http://127.0.0.1:5000/weather?city=Atlanta). In addition, I used the curl method. #City name must be entered or else an error message will display.
